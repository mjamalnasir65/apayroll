# 📱 PWA Development Document – Foreign Worker Payroll PWA
**Date:** 2025-08-25

---

## 1. 🌐 Overview

This PWA is designed to empower foreign workers in Malaysia by providing a platform to track salary payments, maintain personal payroll records, and facilitate salary collection through wallet-based transactions. It functions as a **worker-centric compliance tool** while also serving as a **marketing funnel** for wallets, APS agencies, and future employer-side services.

---

## 2. 🎯 Objectives

- Allow foreign workers to self-register and subscribe to payroll tracking service.
- Log monthly salary expectations and payment receipts.
- Serve as communication bridge between workers and employers.
- Collect subscription fee via wallet-based payment (RM60/year).
- Create income opportunities from wallet partners, APS License C, and optional employer dashboard.
- Remain legally safe by avoiding fund custody and focusing on user-initiated transactions.

---

## 3. 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, TailwindCSS (via CDN), JavaScript (DOM-based)
- **Backend (optional)**: PHP + MySQL (for admin and employer dashboard)
- **Hosting**: local WAMP stack server during development
- **Integration-ready**: API folder for SDKs (e.g. M1Pay, Finexus, Merchantrade, etc.)
- **Framework (UI scaffold)**: No framework or optional Framework7 for future native builds
