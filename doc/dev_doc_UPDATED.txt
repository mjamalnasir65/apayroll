PWA DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENT

========================
1. OVERVIEW
========================
This PWA is a salary collection and payroll coordination system designed for foreign workers in Malaysia. It acts as a service bridge between workers and their employers by allowing workers to track and verify payments, and employers to submit salary proofs, all without directly integrating third-party payment modules.

========================
2. OBJECTIVE
========================
- Empower foreign workers with transparency and control over salary tracking.
- Offer employers a compliant and organized dashboard to manage salary submissions.
- Serve as a neutral third-party payroll dashboard to avoid direct legal or financial liabilities.
- Monetize via worker subscriptions, agency partnerships, and potential wallet collaborations.

========================
3. TECH STACK
========================
- Frontend: HTML5, TailwindCSS, JavaScript (Vanilla or modular)
- Backend: PHP 8+, MySQL (InnoDB)
- Hosting: Local WAMP during development; future deployment on HTTPS web host.
- API/Integration: Payment gateway SDK/API (M1Pay, Finexus), optional later
- Architecture: PWA-first (with option to compile native app later via Capacitor or similar tools)

6. FEATURE LOCKING LOGIC
========================
- Each user account (including employer) has a 'subscription_status' field in DB.
- Premium features only unlocked if subscription_status == 'active'.
- UI will hide or overlay 'Upgrade to Unlock' tag for locked features.
- Backend route guard will also enforce role & plan checking.
